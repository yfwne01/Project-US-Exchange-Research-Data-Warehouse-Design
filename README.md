# Project-US-Exchange-Research-Data-Warehouse-Design


The aim of this project is to build a data warehouse and a system that:


1. Automate daily API data-extraction in AWS for stock prices


2. Integrate and transform the daily data along with other associated financial data (e.g. valuation ratio, earnings and income statement, etc.) 


3. Load the clean and transformed data to a DW and a star schema for specific technical analyses

4. Present the analyses in a visualization format using Tableau dashboard
